     * By default, *Lingua* returns the most likely language for a given
     * input text. However, there are certain words that are spelled the
     * same in more than one language. The word *prologue*, for instance,
     * is both a valid English and French word. Lingua would output either
     * English or French which might be wrong in the given context.
     * For cases like that, it is possible to specify a minimum relative
     * distance that the logarithmized and summed up probabilities for
     * each possible language have to satisfy.
     *
     * Be aware that the distance between the language probabilities is
     * dependent on the length of the input text. The longer the input
     * text, the larger the distance between the languages. So if you
     * want to classify very short text phrases, do not set the minimum
     * relative distance too high. Otherwise you will get most results
     * returned as [Language.UNKNOWN] which is the return value for cases
     * where language detection is not reliably possible.
     *
     * @param distance A value between 0.0 and 0.99. Defaults to 0.0.
     * @throws [IllegalArgumentException] if [distance] is not between 0.0 and 0.99.
