        Weinberg provides an example of how different goals can have a dramatic effect on both effort required and efficiency.
        Furthermore, he notes that programmers will generally aim to achieve any explicit goals which may be set, probably at the expense of any other quality attributes.
        Sommerville has identified four generalised attributes which are not concerned with what a program does, but how well the program does it:
